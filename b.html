            <p style="color: yellowgreen"><i>Grand Canyon National Park is America’s most spectacular landscape, a 277-mile long, 5,000ft deep kaleidoscopic gorge of the Colorado River that cuts through the high desert plains of Arizona like a golden knife.<br>
                 At dawn, the cliffs are brush-stroked in pink and gold; at dusk, they glow red like embers. But the true wonder of the Grand Canyon is in the rocks themselves.<br>
                  Written into these sheer cliffs is one of the most complete geological records on the planet – nearly two billion years of the earth’s history etched into stone, from the Kaibab Limestone laid down at its summit 260 million years ago to the 1.8-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist at its base. <br>
                  Studying the rocks, layer by layer, you can almost see desert become swamp, oceans advance and retreat, and mountains rise and fall again. It’s like looking at time itself.

            <p style="color:yellowgreen"><i> de Uyuni, in southwestern Bolivia, is the largest salt flat in the world. About 4,000 square miles of stark white hexagonal patterns stretch out to an infinite horizon, like the surface of another world.<br>
                 In dry season it’s spectacular; in rainy season, as a thin film of water gathers on the surface to create what amounts to the world’s largest natural mirror, it’s jaw-dropping. The world above is reflected in perfect symmetry; below, you can walk on mirrored clouds in the day or float amid the Milky Way at night.This year, you can see it in style, too.<br>
                 Kachi Lodge, which opens in spring, is the first permanent luxury camp on the flats, made up of just six luxury geodesic domes, each gorgeously designed, with panoramic views across this strange, ethereal world from the comfort of your plush double bed. It doesn’t get better than that.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salar_de_Uyuni" target="_blank">salar de uyuni</a></i></p><hr></li></th>

<p style="color: yellowgreen"><i> July 2019 marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Moon landing. Follow in the First Man’s footsteps this year with a trip to Teide National Park in Tenerife, which Neil Armstrong described as the closest thing to the lunar landscape he’d ever seen on earth – a vast expanse of jagged red rocks and volcanic crags unfurling in all directions like an ocean of frozen stone.<br>
     It’s as close as the layman is likely to come to walking on the moon. But there’s something else here that’s just as special: the stars.<br>
     Low light pollution, high altitude and good weather contribute to the best star-gazing conditions in Europe, so you can marvel at the spiralling Milky Way while you’re there.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teide_National_Park" target="_blank">teide national park</a></i></p><hr></th>

     <p style="color: yellowgreen"><i>The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day El Giza, Egypt.<br>
        It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.<br>
        Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to the fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, some Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was thus built as a tomb over a 10- to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. <br>
        Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years until Lincoln Cathedral was finished in 1311 AD. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza" target="_blank">pyramid of giza</a></i></p><hr></th>

          <P style="color: yellowgreen"><i>Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْرَاء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu, is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. <br>
            Petra lies on the slope of Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of the Arabah valley that runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[<br>
            Petra is believed to have been settled as early as 9,000 BC, and it was possibly established in the 4th century BC as the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom.<br>
            The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.<br>
            The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra">petra</a></i></P><hr></th>

               <p style="color: yellowgreen"><i>When Tutankhamun’s tomb was discovered in 1922, it was in pristine condition, having, incredibly, remained undisturbed by grave robbers through the centuries.<br>
                    Since then, tourism has taken its toll, with the marks of millions of visitors diminishing its grandeur. Tutankhamun’s glory was starting to fade.<br>
                    Now, following nearly a decade of painstaking conservation work, King Tut’s tomb is finally completely restored and returned to its original splendour, the walls adorned with brightly painted murals in colours as vivid as when the doors were first sealed 3,300 years ago. But it’s not the only wonder here.<br>
                    The Valley of the Kings holds 63 mausoleums in total in its vast necropolis stretching across the red desert, including the elaborately painted tomb of Ramesses VI and the vast subterranean chambers of Sety I.<br>
                    Like the Great Pyramids of Giza, these historic sites give a powerful sense of the world’s most mysterious and fascinating civilisations. See it now as it’s never been seen before.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankham" target="_blank">tutenkhamuns</a></i></p><hr></th>

                    <p style="color: yellowgreen"><i>In September 2018, the oldest human drawings ever recorded were found in Blombos Cave, 200 miles east of Cape Town.<br>
                         Created about 73,000 years ago, these simple cross marks etched in ochre, like some kind of primeval hashtag, blow away previous estimates by more than 30,000 years.<br>
                         Drawings such as these represent the birth of human creativity and symbolic thinking, marking a turning point in evolution when we began to transcend our animal instincts and expand our imagination.<br>
                         The Blombos Cave proves that this process started far earlier than previously thought possible.
